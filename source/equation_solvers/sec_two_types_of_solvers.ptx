      In most of the exercises in the activities, you may ignore complex solutions involving <m>\displaystyle I= \sqrt{-1}</m>.

    We will make use of two different equations solvers in Maple. Each solver behaves quite differently and has its own strengths and weaknesses.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <c>solve()</c>
          <idx><h>solving equations</h><h>solve</h></idx>
          <ul>
            <li>This solver attempts to solve an equation and then display the solutions in their exact form.</li>
            <li>This solver will give both real and complex solutions. Complex solutions will involve the imaginary value <m>\displaystyle I= \sqrt{-1}</m>.</li>
            <li>Solutions to high-degree polynomials can be very large and may be displayed symbolically using <q><em>RootOf</em></q> placeholders.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <c>fsolve()</c>
          <idx><h>solving equations</h><h>fsolve</h></idx>
          <ul>
            <li>This solver uses numerical approximation methods and displays the solutions in decimal form.</li>
            <li>This solver will give real solutions only.</li>
            <li>The number of digits displayed for a numerical value will be determined by the number assigned to <c>Digits</c>.</li>
            <li>Some solutions may not be found by the methods used by the solver.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a good idea to see the output of both solvers to decide which output is more useful.
    A good strategy is to use <c>solve()</c> and see if the output is helpful.
    If it is not, then you can go back to your command, change it to <c>fsolve()</c>, and rerun the new command.
