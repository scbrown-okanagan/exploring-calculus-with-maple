    For more information on any of these or other commands (for example, the <c>sin()</c> command),
    you can type a question mark followed by the command name:
  </p>
  <console prompt="> ">
    <input>?sin</input>
  </console>
  <p>
    A help menu will open, which describes the required parameters in the order they must be listed, as well as a few examples.
    These examples can be very useful for more complicated procedures. There may also be several options described for you to customize the procedure.

    If you are unsure of the command name for a procedure that you think Maple should have built in, you can also search Maple help.
    For example,
  </p>
  <console prompt="> ">
    <input>?gcd</input>
  </console>
  <p>
    will give a description of commands for finding the greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple of two values.
