  <title>Algebraic Operations</title>
  <p>
    At its elementary level, Maple can be used as a really large, powerful calculator.
    It can do any arithmetic operation including, but not limited to, addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), powers (^),
    and other more complicated operations such as radicals (roots), logarithms, and exponentials.
    Anytime Maple performs an arithmetic operation, it is creating an <em>expression</em>.

      In 2D Math mode (the default font), it is also possible to perform multiplication by including a space between two variables.
      However, do not use brackets for multiplication.
      Maple has no way of knowing whether <m>a(b)</m> is meant as multiplication or as a function of <m>b</m>.
