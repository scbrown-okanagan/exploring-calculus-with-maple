  <title>Multiple Commands at Once</title>
  <p>
    As you may have noticed, each time that we have used Maple input in this tutorial, there is a semicolon <c>;</c> at the end of the line.
    This used to be required in older versions of Maple, though it is no longer mandatory in modern versions.
    <idx><h>mathematical functions</h><h>exponential</h></idx>
    <idx><h>mathematical functions</h><h>nth root@<m>n</m>th root</h></idx>
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason why the semicolon continues to be important is because it tells Maple when one command ends and another begins.
    You can use this to run multiple commands within one Maple input:

      Multiple commands can be run at the same time by placing a semicolon <c>;</c> in between them.
    </p>

  <console prompt="> ">
    <input>surd(x,3); exp(x);</input>
  </console>
  <p>
    <me>
      \displaystyle \sqrt[3]{x}
    </me>
    <me>
      \displaystyle { e}^{x}
    </me>
  </p>

      If you use a full colon <c>:</c> instead of a semicolon,
      then the output of that command is hidden from the screen when it is executed.
