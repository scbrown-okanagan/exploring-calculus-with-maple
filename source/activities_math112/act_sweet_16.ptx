      We all know that <m>16</m> exhibits the following interesting property:
      <me>16 = 2^4 = 4^2.</me>
      In this activity, you will explore whether there exist any other positive integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> (<m>a \not = b</m>) such that
      <md>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_sweet16" number="yes">a^b \amp = b^a</mrow>
      </md>.
      To determine if there are integer solutions to equation <xref ref="eq_sweet16"/>, you will need to rely on unusual tactics, 
      including the use of Rolle's Theorem:

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a function that satisfies the following three hypotheses:
          <ol>
            <li><m>f</m> is continuous on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>.</li>
            <li><m>f</m> is differentiable on the open interval <m>(a,b)</m>.</li>
            <li><m>f(a) = f(b)</m>.</li>
          </ol>
          Then there is a number <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> such that <m>f'(c) = 0</m>.
          <idx><h>Rolle's theorem</h></idx>
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            If we remove the restriction that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have to be integers, then this problem becomes a lot more interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can be shown that for any value <m>N > { e}^{ e}</m>, there exist real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that satisfy
            <m>N = a^b = b^a</m> with <m>a \neq b</m>. To prove this, one needs to be very careful in evaluating the limit
            <me>\lim_{\substack{a \rightarrow 1\\ b \rightarrow \infty} } a^b</me>.
            It is not obvious that this limit goes to infinity. However, if it does, all <m>N > { e}^{ e}</m> will have the desired property.
            It may help to recall that
            <me>\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n = { e}</me>.
            So, just because the base tends to <m>1</m> and the exponent tends to infinity, the value of <m>a^b</m> is not necessarily infinity.

          If you rearrange equation <xref ref="eq_sweet16"/> to separate variables, you can write the equation as 
          <me>\frac{\ln(a)}{a} = \frac{\ln(b)}{b}</me>.
          You can obtain this equivalent equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides of equation <xref ref="eq_sweet16"/>. Then, 
          divide that result by both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. Notice how the equation in this form is set up so that you can apply Rolle's Theorem.

          Now you are ready to apply Rolle's Theorem (and a bit of reasoning) to determine if there are any other positive integers <m>a</m>
          and <m>b</m> that satisfy equation <xref ref="eq_sweet16"/>. There are no calculations to perform in this exercise. Instead, you 
          will need to adequately explain your answers in paragraph form.

          Let's begin by assuming that <m>a \lt b</m>.

            If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> satisfy equation <xref ref="eq_sweet16"/>, then <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>. From what Rolle's Theorem states,
            what does this tell you about the location of a critical value of <m>f(x)</m> where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>?

            Since you have already found the critical value(s) of <m>f(x)</m>, can there be any other positive integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
            such that <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>?
