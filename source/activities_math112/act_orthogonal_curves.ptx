      Orthogonal curves are curves that are perpendicular whenever they intersect. Perpendicular lines are an elementary example of this.
      <idx><h>lines</h><h>perpendicular lines</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that if <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> are the slopes of two perpendicular lines, then <m>m_1 m_2 = -1</m>. Similarly, two curves are 
      orthogonal if their derivatives multiply to <m>-1</m> at every point where they intersect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of curves in this activity are implicit functions, so you will be using the <c>implicitplot()</c> command to visualize them. 
      Make sure to include the <c>plots</c> package using the <c>with()</c> command near the top of your Maple worksheet.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this exercise, you will show that
          <me>y^2 - x^2 = 3 \text{ and } xy = 2</me>
          are orthogonal curves. Start by assigning each equation a name, such as <c>curve1</c> and <c>curve2</c>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Using a single <c>implicitplot()</c> command, plot both curves. The two curves should intersect at two points. If you enforce <m>1:1</m> scaling, 
            do they appear to be perpendicular at the intersection points?

          <p>
            Do not forget to include multiplication between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> when defining the equation of the second curve.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <hint>
          <p>
            <m>1:1</m> scaling can be enfored by adding the optional <c>scaling=constrained</c> parameter to the <c>implicitplot()</c> command.

          <p>
            When plotting an equation using the <c>implicitplot()</c> command, the graph may not always appear smooth. This was especially common in earlier editions of Maple.
            If this is ever the case, you may include either <c>numpoints=30000</c> or <c>grid=[250,250]</c> as a parameter in the <c>implicitplot()</c> command to increase the 
            number of plot points.

            Solve the system of two equations to find the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-coordinates of the two points of intersection.

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            In order to find points of intersection, Maple can solve a system of equations in one <c>solve()</c>  or <c>fsolve()</c> command for both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
            If you choose to use the <c>solve()</c> command, you may need to include the optional parameter <c>explicit=true</c> to avoid the <em>RootOf()</em> output.

            Use the <c>implicitdiff()</c> command to determine the derivatives of each curve at the first intersection point. Do these slopes multiply to <m>-1</m>?

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            You will need to substitute both an <m>x</m>-coordinate and a <m>y</m>-coordinate into the derivative for each point when using the 
            <c>subs()</c> command.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this exercise, you will investigate two families of curves given by
          <md>
            <mrow xml:id="eq_family1" number="yes"> \amp y = cx^2 </mrow>
            <mrow xml:id="eq_family2" number="yes"> \amp x^2 + 2y^2 = k  \amp k \amp> 0 </mrow>
          </md>
          where <m>c</m> and <m>k</m> are constants. Each choice of <m>c</m> and <m>k</m> gives a slightly different curve of the same <q>family</q>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Using a single <c>plot()</c> command, visualize these families of curves by plotting all of the following examples in one graph:
            <md>
              <mrow> y \amp = -2x^2 \amp x^2 + 2y^2 \amp = 1</mrow>
              <mrow> y \amp =  -x^2 \amp x^2 + 2y^2 \amp = 4</mrow>
              <mrow> y \amp =     0 \amp x^2 + 2y^2 \amp = 9</mrow>
              <mrow> y \amp =   x^2</mrow>
              <mrow> y \amp =  2x^2</mrow>
            </md>
            Ensure that all five curves of the <m>y=cx^2</m> family are the same colour and all three curves of the <m>x^2 + 2y^2 = k</m> family are a single, different 
            colour.

          <p>
            Be sure to include the <c>y=</c> in each of the curves from the first family when using <c>implicitplot()</c>. This command only accepts 
            equations as curves to be plotted.

            Assign equation <xref ref="eq_family1"/> to <c>family1</c> and equation <xref ref="eq_family2"/> to <c>family2</c>. Solve the system of equations to find the <m>x</m>- 
            and <m>y</m>-coordinates of the four intersection points of the two families of curves. The coordinates of the points should be given as expressions 
            involving <m>c</m> and <m>k</m>.
