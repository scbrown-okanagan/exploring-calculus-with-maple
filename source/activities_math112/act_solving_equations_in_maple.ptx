    <p>
      In this activity, you will investigate the two main solvers that Maple uses, <c>solve()</c> and <c>fsolve()</c>.
      In some cases, you may find one is much more helpful than the other. Both commands provide unique benefits 
      in specific circumstances.

          Suppose we want to find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the function
          <me>f(x) = x^5+x^4-4x^3-3x^2+3x+1</me>.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            With <c>fsolve()</c>,
            you can also specify an interval for solutions if you wish to only find a particular solution.
            An example of this can be found in <xref ref="sec_solving_an_equation_of_one_variable" />.

            Assign the function to <m>f(x)</m> using the assignment operator <c>:=</c>.

            Plot <m>f(x)</m>, choosing ranges for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> so that you can clearly see all five
            <m>x</m>-intercepts on the graph (you may need to adjust each a few times).

            Try factoring <m>f(x)</m> to see if it is factorable. Does this method work for finding the <m>x</m>-intercepts?

            Try solving <m>f(x)=0</m> using the <c>solve()</c> command. Maple will attempt to give exact values of all five roots.
            Note that for challenging equations such as this one, the output may be more symbollic than you may prefer.

            Finally, try solving <m>f(x)=0</m> using the <c>fsolve()</c> command. Maple will only attempt to give numerical approximations
            of all five roots. The number of digits given will depend on the current value assigned to <c>Digits</c>.

          Let's look at how these two solvers behave differently for the quadratic equation <m>x^2+4x+6=0</m>.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            Using <c>solve()</c> followed by an <c>evalf()</c> command is not the same as using <c>fsolve()</c> is most cases! In this example,
            one solver behaves quite differently from the other. The fact that one solver gives exact values and other other gives a 
            numerical approximation is not the only difference.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            First, start off by solving the quadratic without Maple using the formula
            <me>x=\dfrac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</me>
            to see if the equation has two real roots, one repeated root, or no real roots.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Now, solve the quadratic using the <c>solve()</c> command. This solver allows for the display of 
            imaginary roots using <m>I = \sqrt{-1}</m>.
            <idx><h>imaginary</h></idx>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Finally, solve the quadratic using the <c>fsolve()</c> command. Since this solver uses numerical approximation,
            it will only display real roots (if it finds any).
          </p>
        </statement>

    <exercise>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this exercise, you will be finding the intersection point <c>(x,y)</c> of the curves <m>y=x^2</m> and <m>y=\frac{3}{x}</m>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Plot <m>x^2</m> and <m>\frac{3}{x}</m> using a single <c>plot()</c> command and adjust the command as necessary to view both 
            curves and their intersection point.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            When multiple curves are plotted on the same set of axes, it is a good practice to specify the colour of each one. You can do 
            this after specifying the ranges for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          </p>
        </hint>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Use either solver (<c>solve()</c> or <c>fsolve()</c>) to find the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values of the point of intersection.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            There are multiple ways that you can solve for both! You may start by solving <m>x=\frac{3}{x}</m> to find the <m>x</m>-coordinate
            first and then use <c>subs()</c> to find <m>y</m>. Instead, you may want to solve a system of equations in one command. An example 
            is provided in <xref ref="sec_solving_a_system"/>
