      Before starting on these exercises, you should familiarize yourself with the material covered in the following tutorials:

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      Limits may seem trivial when you first learn them, but they are fundamental building blocks in calculus.
      They are used to explain terms like <q>infinitesimally small</q> and <q>infinitely large</q>. It may be interesting 
      to know that they can also be used in applied problems. This activity will explore a geometry problem and will solve 
      it using limits, instead of an elementary geometric approach.

      <xref ref="fig_applied_limit">Figure</xref> below shows two circles:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <m>C_1</m>, centred at the point <m>(1,0)</m> with radius <m>1</m> and equation
          <me>(x-1)^2+y^2=1</me>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>C_2</m>, centred at the origin with radius <m>r</m> and equation

      If we define <m>P</m> as the point <m>(0,r)</m> at the top of the circle <m>C_2</m>,
      and <m>Q</m> as the upper point of intersection of the two circles,
      then we can construct the line <m>PQ</m> and see that it crosses the <m>x</m>-axis.
      Let <m>R</m> be the <m>x</m>-intercept of the line <m>PQ</m>.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Note that neither <m>P</m> nor <m>Q</m> is fixed as the radius of <m>C_2</m> shrinks.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Now, begin to shrink the radius of circle <m>C_2</m>; that is, let <m>r\rightarrow 0^{+}</m>.
      What happens to the point <m>R</m> as <m>C_2</m> shrinks?

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assign names to the equations of both circles, such as <c>C1</c> and <c>C2</c>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the point of intersection of <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> in quadrant I. These are the coordinates of <m>Q</m> 
          and should be expressions of <m>r</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          You can find the point of intersection with a single <c>solve()</c> command, using both equations and solving for 
          <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> at once. See <xref ref="sec_solving_a_system"/> for an example.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <hint>
        <p>
          You may need to include the optional parameter <c>explicit=true</c> to avoid the <em>RootOf()</em> output when using the
          <c>solve()</c> command.

          Now that you have the coordinates of two points, <m>P = (0,r)</m> and <m>Q</m> (from the previous exercise), you can 
          construct the equation of the line <m>PQ</m>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find the slope of the line <m>PQ</m> using the slope equation
            <me>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</me>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Using the fact that the <m>y</m>-intercept is known to be <m>(0,r)</m>, assign the equation of the line
            <me>L(x) = m x + r</me>.

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Make sure to include multiplication or a space between two symbols, <m>m</m> and <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </hint>
      </task>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the <m>x</m>-coordinate of point <m>R</m> by solving <m>L(x)=0</m> (the <m>x</m>-intercept of this line). 
          This coordinate should also be an expression involving <m>r</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Finally, you can determine what happens as the red circle shrinks. Determine the limit of <m>R</m> as <m>r \to 0^+</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Make sure to use a right-hand limit when using the <c>limit()</c> command.
