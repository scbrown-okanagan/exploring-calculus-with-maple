  <title>Three Font Styles</title>
  <p>
    There are two font styles that are commonly used in execution groups.

      While 2D Math has the advantage of looking prettier, it often treats spaces as multiplication and it doesn't 
      always treat brackets as multiplication when desired. Maple Input causes fewer issues with how Maple interprets
      but it often requires the use of many more parenthesis. This lab manual will make frequent use of Maple Input 
      for clarity, but you will likely use 2D Math for most of your exercises.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q>2D Math</q> (the default in modern versions)
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>In this mode, mathematical expressions are formatted nicely, as one would write them on paper.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Text will appear in <em>italic</em>, with the exception of common mathematical functions and constants.</p>

              <p>
                An example of an expression in 2D Math:
                <me> \displaystyle {\frac {{x}^{5}}{{ e}^{x}+\sin \left( x \right) }} </me>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Switch to 2D Math using Ctrl+R.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q>Maple Input</q> (the default for old versions)
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>In this mode, mathematical expressions are displayed inline, with no additional formatting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                All text is shown in <c>monospaced font</c>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The above expression in Maple input:</p>
              <pre> x^5/(exp(x)+sin(x)) </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Switch to Maple Input using Ctrl+M.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, paragraphs use a third style of font.

    <p>
      It can be useful to switch to 2D Math in paragraphs for an expression or equation, then switch back to text afterwards.

            <li>
