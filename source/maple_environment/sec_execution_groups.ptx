  <title>Execution Groups</title>
  <p>
    Maple input is used for computations and must use recognizable commands.
    Maple output gives the result of the computation after hitting the Enter key.
    Together, Maple input and output are called an
    <em>execution group</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place a new execution group after the current line with the <image width="5%" source="images/new_input.png"/> button.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place a new execution group after the current line with Ctrl+J.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place a new execution group before the current line with Ctrl+K.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Maple input is preceded by the <m>></m> character
    (sometimes called a "carrot").
    Maple output is displayed in the centre of the following line.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <image width="50%" source="images/InsertInput.png"/>
  </aside>
  <p>
    <console prompt="> ">
      <input>2 + 2;</input>
    </console>
    <me>
      4
    </me>
    <console prompt="> ">
      <input>8 / 2;</input>
    </console>
    <me>
      4
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    If at any point you wish to correct a previous Maple input line,
    you may simply go back to that line and modify it.
    However, there will be no change to the output until you hit Enter.
    You do not need to be at the end of the line in order to run it.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may wish to have more than one calculation or command on a single Maple input.
