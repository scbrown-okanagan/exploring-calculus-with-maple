  <title>Using Sections</title>
  <p>
    <em>Sections</em> are groups of one or more execution groups or paragraphs that are indented together.
    At the top of a section, you can create a section title.
    An arrow to the left of the title will allow you to expand or collapse that section.
    Subsections may be created inside other sections.
