  <title>Using Sections</title>
  <p>
    <em>Sections</em> are groups of one or more execution groups or paragraphs that are indented together.
    At the top of a section, you can create a section title.
    An arrow to the left of the title will allow you to expand or collapse that section.
    Subsections may be created inside other sections.

      You may wish to highlight several execution groups or paragraphs with the mouse before combining them into one section.
