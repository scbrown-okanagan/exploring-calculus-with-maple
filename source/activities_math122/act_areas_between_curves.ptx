    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <p>
      Consider two functions, <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>. We can find the total area between these two curves over an interval 
      <m>a \le x \le b</m> by integrating the absolute value of the difference between these two functions.
      In other words,
      <me>\text{ Total Area }  = \displaystyle\int_a^b \abs{f(x)-g(x)}\,dx</me>.
      <idx><h>integral</h><h>total area</h></idx>
      If <m>f(x) \ge g(x)</m> over that interval, then the absolute value can be dropped. However, if <m>g(x) \ge f(x)</m> over 
      that interval, then the absolute value can be dropped and the order of subtraction reversed.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x)\ge g(x)</m> for some subintervals of <m>a \le x \le b</m> and <m>g(x) \ge f(x)</m> for other subintervals of 
        <m>a \le x \le b</m>, then the integral must be split into these subintervals to handle the absolute value accordingly. 
        This process typically involves having to solve for the intersection points of the functions. However, Maple handles this 
        process automatically.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      In other circumstances, we may be interested in the net area between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>. For example, if 
      <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> both represent rates of change of some quantity, then the net area
      <me>\text{ Net Area }  = \displaystyle\int_a^b \left(f(x)-g(x)\right)\,dx</me>
      will give us the net difference between the two quantities over an interval. The net area may be negative, while the total 
      area will always be positive.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this exercise, you will find the area of the region bounded by the curves
          <me>y = x^2 - c^2 \;\; \text{ and }  \;\; y = c^2 - x^2</me>
          and ultimately, determine the value of <m>c</m> that gives an exact area of 576.

        <statement>
          <p>
            To begin, you should view the region between the two curves. Choose a nonzero value for <m>c</m> and plot <m>y = x^2 - c^2</m> 
            and <m>y=c^2 - x^2</m> using your choice of <m>c</m>. Adjust the view as necessary and estimate the <m>x</m>-coordinates of 
            the two points of intersection.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Maple will not be able to plot these two curves on the <m>xy</m>-plane without substituting in some value of <m>c</m>, since 
            <m>c</m> would be viewed as an unexpected third variable in the equation of each curve.

            Use the <c>solve()</c> (or <c>fsolve()</c>) command to find the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the two intersection points of
            <m>y = x^2 - c^2</m> and <m>y = c^2 - x^2</m>. These <m>x</m>-coordinates should be dependant on <m>c</m>.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          Suppose that two runners are competing in a two-minute sprint. After <m>t</m> seconds, the velocity of runner A is given by
          <me>v_A(t) = \frac{64.8 { e}^{-0.018t}}{(1 + 3{ e}^{-0.018t})^2}</me>
          and the velocity of runner B is given by
          <me>v_B(t) = \frac{90.0 { e}^{-0.015t}}{(1 + 4{ e}^{-0.015t})^2}</me>.
          Both velocities are in m/s. Start by assigning each of these functions, using the assignment operator, <c>:=</c>.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            Since velocity is a rate of change of position, integrating velocity over an interval of time gives the net change in position,
            called displacement. Integrating the difference of two velocity functions gives the net difference between the two displacements.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Plot both velocity functions on the same axes for duration of <m>2</m> minutes (use <m>0 \leq t \leq 120</m>,since <m>t</m> 
            is in seconds). Using your graph, try to guess which runner makes it the farthest distance in <m>2</m> minutes.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Make sure that you defined the exponential function properly in the two velocity functions. You can use the <c>exp()</c> 
            function for <m>e^x</m> or use the palettes toolbar. You cannot use the letter <sq>e</sq> on the keyboard for the exponential 
            function.

            It is a good idea to choose colours for each function so that you can tell them apart on your plot.

            Find the net area between <m>v_A(t)</m> and <m>v_B(t)</m> on the interval <m>[0,120]</m>. This corresponds to the net 
            difference in displacement during the race. Which runner made it the farthest distance in <m>2</m> minutes? By how 
            many metres?
