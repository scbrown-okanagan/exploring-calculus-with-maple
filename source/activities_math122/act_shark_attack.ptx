    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <p>
      In this activity, you will determine whether you can swim to safety before a shark attacks. You will need to use piecewise 
      functions and the Net Change Theorem to find the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that you are surfing on the ocean and there is a shark 50 metres behind you, at rest (i.e. <m>v(0)=0</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The shark senses you and begins accelerating toward you at a rate of 5 m/s<m>^2</m>, up to a top speed of 13 m/s. You see the shark coming 
      and begin swimming towards shore at a speed of 2 m/s. Assume there is no time needed for you to accelerate up to your top speed. If the 
      shore is 20 m away from you (and 70 m away from the shark), do you make it to shore before the shark attacks?

      For convenience, we will let the shark's initial position be <m>0</m> m and your initial position be <m>50</m> m. This means that the shore 
      is at a position of <m>70</m> m.

    <exercise>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this exercise, you will create a function that gives the position of the shark at time <m>t</m>, relative to its initial position.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            The shark's distance function will contain an acceleration term for <m>0 \le t \le t_1</m> (where <m>t_1</m> is the time you find in 
            <xref ref="ex_sharktime">exercise</xref>) but will not have an acceleration term after <m>t_1</m> seconds.

          <p>
            Calculate by hand or using Maple how long it takes for the shark to reach its top speed of 13 m/s if it accelerates at 5 m/s<m>^2</m>.
            Assign this time to <c>t1</c>. Note that the shark will no longer accelerate after <m>t_1</m> seconds, since it has reached its top speed.

            Integrate <m>sharkvelocity(t)</m> with respect to <m>t</m> to find the position function for the shark. Assign this piecewise position function to

          Since your swim velocity is constant, determining your position function is much simpler. Assign the function <m>swimvelocity(t) = 2</m> and integrate 
          <m>swimvelocity(t)</m> with respect to <m>t</m> to find your displacement function (the net change from your initial position). Add 50 to this distance 
          function for your initial position and assign it to <c>swimposition</c>.

            Plot the position functions for you and the shark on the same graph. Be sure that your position graph includes your 50 m head start. Adjust your plot so 
            that you can see the moment that the shark catches up to you.

          Instead of swimming, let's suppose you hop on your board and surf the nearest wave away from the shark. The wave accelerates you at <m>2</m> m/s<m>^2</m> 
          initially up to a top speed of <m>4</m> m/s.

            Define a new piecewise function for the velocity of surfing the way and assign it to <m>surfvelocity(t)</m>.

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            The piecewise function for your surfing velocity will be similar to the one you set up for the shark in exercise <xref ref="ex_sharkvelocity"/>.
