    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <p>
      According to Hooke's law (<m>F=-kx</m>) and Newton's second law (<m>F=ma</m>), the differential equation for the motion 
      of a mass (<m>m</m>) on the end of a spring is
      <me>m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-kx</me>,
      where <m>k</m> is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the spring). This equation assumes no damping (resistance).
      The displacement of the mass from equilibrium is denoted by <m>x</m>, and thus <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> is the velocity, and 
      <m>\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}</m> is the acceleration.

    </figure>
    <p>
      If we add damping (resistance) to the spring, then the damping is opposite the direction of the motion and proportional to 
      the velocity. Therefore we have the equation,
      <me>m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-kx-c\frac{dx}{dt}</me>,
      where <m>c</m> is the damping constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following exercises, you will assume that the mass is <m>m=2</m> kg and the spring constant is <m>k=3</m> kg/s<m>^2</m>.
      You will look at the equation of motion with no damping (<m>c=0</m>), overdamping (<m>c=4</m> kg/s), and underdamping 
      (<m>c=0.5</m> kg/s).
    </p>
    <p>
      In all cases, you will use the initial conditions <m>x(0)=1</m> m and <m>x'(0)=-1</m> m/s.

            To solve these differential equations algebraically you assume that solutions are of the form
            <m>x(t)={ e}^{rt}</m> and then plug it into the differential equation to get the
            <q>characteristic equation</q>
            to solve for <m>r</m>.
            If the roots are complex, you will have oscillations
            (sine and cosine functions)
            and if the roots are real, then you have strictly exponential solutions.
            Notice that the overdamped case has no oscillations whereas the underdamping and no-damping cases have oscillations in their solutions.
