      In this activity, you will investigate differential equations that arise from the mixture of fluid in a tank. You will need to have some 
      basic understanding of the relationship between mass, volume, and concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concentration is defined as
      <me>\text{ concentration } =\frac{\text{ mass } }{\text{ volume } }</me>.
      Therefore, to determine mass given a volume and concentration,
      <me>\text{ mass } =\text{ concentration } \times\text{ volume }</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you are having a wedding and you start with a 5 L tank of coffee that has a concentration of 60 g/L. The wedding guests are 
      drinking the coffee at a rate of 0.2 L/min. You are refilling the tank at a rate of 0.15 L/min with coffee of a concentration of 50 g/L.

      In the following exercises, you will set up an solve differential equations that describe the mass of coffee in the tank as well as the 
      concentration of coffee in the tank at a given time.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          To begin, you will need to determine the volume of coffee in the tank at any given time. Since the flow rate in is different from 
          the flow rate out, this volume is not constant.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Set up a differential equation for the rate of change of volume of coffee in the tank using <m>V'(t) = (\text{ rate in } ) - (\text{ rate out } )</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Solve this differential equation using the initial condition to obtain a formula for the volume <m>V(t)</m> after <m>t</m> minutes.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Use the <c>solve()</c><idx><h>solving equations</h><h>solve</h></idx> command to compute how long it will be until you run out of coffee.

    <exercise>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Using the given information and the volume of coffee in the tank at time <m>t</m> from the previous exercise, you can now determine the mass of coffee 
          in the tank at any given time.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Set up a differential equation for the mass of coffee in the tank using
            <me>
              m'(t) = \lrp{\begin{array}{l} \text{ concentration } \\ \text{ entering tank } \end{array} }
                      \lrp{\begin{array}{l} \text{ volume } \\ \text{ rate in } \end{array} }
                      - \lrp{\begin{array}{l} \text{ concentration } \\ \text{ in tank at time } t \end{array} }
                        \lrp{\begin{array}{l} \text{ volume }   \\ \text{ rate out } \end{array} }
            </me>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            The concentration entering the tank, the volume rate in, and the volume rate out are all given. However, the concentration in the tank at time 
            <m>t</m> will need given as a fraction of mass <m>m(t)</m> divided by volume <m>V(t)</m>. This volume comes from the previous exercise, but 
            <m>m(t)</m> remains an unknown function until you can solve this differential equation.
