      Volumes of Revolution are often very challenging to visualize on paper. Luckily, Maple has an interactive way of 
      visualizing the volume obtained by revolving a region about a central axis. In this activity, we will use the Volume 
      of Revolution Tutor to find and plot the volume of a region rotated about a vertical axis or horizontal axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Volume of Revolution Tutor is able to determine the volume of the solid obtained by revolution using either the 
      disks/washers method or the method of cylindrical shells. You can learn more about how to access and use this tutor in 
      <xref ref="sec_volume_of_revolution_tutor"/>.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In the first three exercises of this activity, you will be working with the region bounded by the functions 
          <m>f(x)=x^5-x^3</m> and <m>g(x)=\sin(x)</m>, where <m>x \geq 0</m>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Assign these two functions in Maple using the assignment operator, <c>:=</c>.

      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Plot the graphs of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> on the same set of axes to view the region that you will be 
            revolving about an axis in the next couple exercies.

      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            As you can see from your plot, the functions intersect at <m>x_1=0</m> and at another value where <m>x_2&gt;0</m>. 
            Solve for this second value, <m>x_2</m> where the functions intersect and assign it to <c>x2</c>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            An example of finding intersection points is given in <xref ref="sec_solvingsystemeqs"/>.

  <!--TODO: Switch order of next two exercises. Make disks/washers one use int() or Int() command. Make the other use only the tutor
  with an option task if students know the shells method -->

                    You will need to include the <c>Student[Calculus1]</c> package by typing <c>with(Student[Calculus1]):</c> on a new line before the <c>VolumeOfRevolution()</c> command will work.

                    When plotting the ellipse, it may initially look like a circle.
                    This is because Maple does not use the same scaling for each axis.
                    Try clicking on the plot and using the <image width="50%" source="images/1-1.png"/> button in the top menu.
