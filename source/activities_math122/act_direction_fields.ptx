      In this activity, you will use direction fields to predict the population dynamics for a population of rabbits. You will need 
      to include the <c>DETools</c> package in your Maple worksheet to use the <c>DEplot()</c> command.

      Suppose that you have a population of rabbits and <m>P(t)</m> is the number of rabbits at time <m>t</m>. A basic model for the 
      population of rabbits could be given as 
      <men xml:id="eq_rabbits_basic">
        \frac{dP}{dt}=\alpha P - \beta P
      </men>,
      where <m>\alpha</m> is the birth rate and <m>\beta</m> is the death rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, equation <xref ref="eq_rabbits_basic"/> does not consider limitations due to habitat and food supply. If you wish to use 
      a more accurate model, then you may consider the logistic growth model
      <men xml:id="eq_rabbits_logistic">
        \frac{dP}{dt}= kP \left(1-\frac{P}{M}\right)
      </men>,
      where <m>k</m> is the relative growth rate and <m>M</m> is the carrying capacity (the maximum population that is sustainable).
    </p>
    <p>
      The death rate of the rabbits (due to hunting) can be added to this logistic model to obtain the differential equation
      <men xml:id="eq_rabbits_logistic_hunted">
        \frac{dP}{dt}=kP \left(1-\frac{P}{M}\right)-bP
      </men>,
      where <m>b</m> is the hunting rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following exercises, you will examine solutions to equations <xref ref="eq_rabbits_basic"/><ndash/><xref ref="eq_rabbits_logistic_hunted"/> 
      using two  different initial conditions: <m>P(0)=1</m> and <m>P(0)=50</m>.

          Most mammal population growth is dependent upon other species in the region, via an interconnected food web. One simple 
          predator-prey model is the Lotka-Volterra model
          <md>
            <mrow xml:id="eq_rabbits_lotka_volterra" number="yes">\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = \alpha x-\beta xy</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = \gamma xy-\delta y,\nonumber</mrow>
          </md>
          where <m>x(t)</m> is the population of prey and <m>y(t)</m> is the population of predators. In this equation, the prey grow and 
          are eaten by predators. The predators' growth depends on eating the prey and the predators have a death rate.
        </p>

            Open the DE Plots Tutor from the Tools menu, under Tutors and Differential Equations. Select the Lotka-Volterra Model and click 
            DEPlot. Try changing the parameters and the initial conditions to get a sense of how the prey population <m>x(t)</m> and predator 
            population <m>y(t)</m> are connected. Then click quit to display a plot on your Maple worksheet.
