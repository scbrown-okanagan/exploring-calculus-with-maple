    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <p>
      The Taylor series of a function <m>f(x)</m> centred at <m>a</m> is the infinite series
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
      </me>
      where <m>n!</m> is using the factorial operator, defined by
      <md>
        <mrow> n! \amp = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(3)(2)(1) \quad (n \geq 1) </mrow>
        <mrow> 0! \amp = 1 </mrow>
      </md>.
      Writing out the first <m>n</m> terms of a Taylor series gives the <m>n</m>th degree Taylor polynomial approximation of <m>f(x)</m>:
      <mdn>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_taylor1">f(x) \amp \approx f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a)</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_taylor2">f(x) \amp \approx f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_taylor3">f(x) \amp \approx f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3</mrow>
      </mdn>.
      Equation <xref ref="eq_taylor1"/> should look familiar; it is the linear approximation formula and the equation of the tangent line to 
      <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>! Similarly, equation <xref ref="eq_taylor2"/> gives quadratic approximation and equation <xref ref="eq_taylor3"/>
      gives cubic approximation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparing the graphs of these Taylor polynomial approximation so the graph of <m>f(x)</m> can reveal information about the <em>interval of 
      convergence</em> of the Taylor series. This is the interval for <m>x</m> over which the Taylor series convergences to the graph of <m>f(x)</m>.
      This interval is always centred at <m>x=a</m>. The <em>radius of convergence</em> is exactly half the width of the interval and may be infinite if 
      the Taylor series converges to <m>f(x)</m> over the entire real number line.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this activity, you will calculate Taylor series of functions centred at <m>a=0</m>:
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n = f(0) + \frac{f'(0)}{1!}x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3 + \cdots
      </me>.
      This specific type of Taylor series is also commonly known as a Maclaurin series. You will compute and plot Taylor polynomial approximations and 
      compare their graphs to the function to understand how the radius of convergence works.

          In this exercise, you will calculate several Taylor polynomial approximations for <m>f(x) = \cos(x)</m> centred at <m>a=0</m> and consider 
          the interval of convergence of the Taylor series.

            The second degree Taylor polynomial can be obtained by using the command <c>taylor(cos(x), x=0, 3)</c>. This can then be converted to a 
            polynomial and assigned to the name <c>poly2</c> using the command <c>poly2 := convert(%, polynom)</c>. Both of these commands can be 
            written on a single Maple input with a semicolon between them.

            If you were to increase the degree infinitely, you should expect that the approximation will converge to the radius of convergence

          Because the higher derivatives of <m>\cos(x)</m> and <m>\ln(1+x)</m> both form predictable patterns when evaluated at <m>a=0</m>, it is 
          possible to write the Taylor series for these functions centred at <m>a=0</m> in their compact forms:
