  "title": "Lab Description",
  "body": " Lab Description   Purpose of Lab  Your lab section is designed to supplement the content that you are learning in lecture. You will be applying those lecture topics during the lab through Maple, which is a powerful computational software. It is the goal of the lab to aid in your understanding of calculus as well as introduce you to the tools of mathematics that are available through computers.    Lab Expectations  Each week you will work on a new activity from this lab manual. Your lab instructor will inform you of which activity you will be working on each week. You must complete each component of each activity individually. Plagiarism of lab work will not be tolerated.       Prior to lab  Before lab, read through the activity as well as the recommended tutorials from the back of the book. Once you have read through the instructions and tutorials, you will need to complete the reading quiz for the activity.   Some lab computers take a couple minutes to log into. Always give yourself a few extra minutes at the start of lab to log in.     Start of lab  After logging into the school computer, you should begin by opening up the latest version of Maple as well your lab section's Moodle page. You are expected to have this lab manual with you during lab and you should complete all exercises in order. It is a great idea to have a pen or pencil handy to take notes in your manual while you complete the exercises. Your lab instructor will be available to assist you with the activity, though you will find that many of your questions can be answered by looking through the tutorial sections at the back of this book.    End of lab  Once you have completed the exercises, make sure to save your work! You are now ready to complete the activity quiz . The questions in this quiz should be relatively quick to answer once you have completed the exercises from the activity. Often, you can simply copy and paste the output from Maple into the blanks on the quiz. You will be required to submit your Maple work in the final question of the quiz.   The questions on your Moodle quiz relate to the exercises in this book. Make sure to finish your exercises prior to the quiz.     Final lab  During your final lab, you will be expected to complete an open-book lab test . The test will be based upon the activities that you have completed throughout the semester. You are permitted to have this manual during the test.    Lab Test  During your lab test, you will be permitted the following materials:  This lab manual  Handwritten notes  Maple help  Previously completed activities    The following are not allowed:  Discussion with other students  Cell phones  Other electronic devices  Email  Internet (other than Moodle for file submission)    You will be allowed to ask for clarification on questions, but will not be allowed to ask for assistance in completing a question or resolving an error in your work.  You will be expected to submit your work electronically and any duplicate submissions will receive a grade of zero. It is important to save your work frequently in case your computer encounters a serious error.   Don't forget to save your file in your cloud storage (OneDrive) . This folder is accessible from any computer. Saving your files is explained in detail in the next chapter.    "

  "title": "Introduction to Maple",
  "body": " Introduction to Maple   The Maple Computer Algebra System  In lab, you will be using the latest version of Maple, which is a symbolic and numeric computing environment. Maple provides an interface for analyzing, exploring, visualizing, and solving mathematical problems. The interface also allows you to maintain an easy-to-follow document so that you can retrace your thought process. If you plan to pursue any branch of mathematics or field that relies on mathematics, having basic knowledge of a computer algebra system is a very useful tool.    How to Use This Manual  This book is divided into three main parts:   Part and Part consist of activities for you to complete. These activities are divided into two chapters: Calculus I and Calculus II. Each activity focuses on one topic from that course and contains a list of exercises for you to complete with Maple. Some of these exercises may give very explicit instructions for typing a command into Maple, while others may require you to use your own intuition and understanding of the capabilities of Maple.   Part consists of several chapters that provide examples of the usage of common commands in Maple. Many of these examples are designed to be minimalistic in order to show you their basic usage. Each of these examples was completed within Maple and should be reproducible on your own computer.  At the beginning of each activity, a list of the most relevant tutorials is given. It is expected that you read through those tutorials as you complete the exercises of that activity. Many activities build upon previously learned commands, so it is a good idea to thoroughly read through all of the relevant tutorials as you progress through lab.    Accessing Maple  Maple is installed on all lab computers as well as on computers in the library. However, personal copies of Maple are not available through Okanagan College at this time.    Opening Maple on School Computers  On most Windows computers, the current version of Maple is installed directly. In this case, you can simply hit the Start Menu key on your keyboard (in the lower left corner) and begin typing the word \"Maple\". Windows Search will automatically find the version installed and display a link to the application. Alternatively, you should be able to find Maple by browsing the list of installed programs on the Start Menu.  On other computers, you may need to log into a virtual machine to access Maple remotely. On these machines, you will typically find a link to VMware Horizon Client on the desktop. You will need to open this client and log into the remote machine using the same information as you previously used to log into the computer. Once the remote machine loads, you should find Maple in the Start Menu as described above.  If you are prompted to install an available update to Maple on a school computer, you may hit Cancel to decline the update.     Organizing Files in your OneDrive  You are given your own personal cloud storage through your college Microsoft account. You can find this folder by opening up File Explorer on a school computer.   Look for your OneDrive folder with the cloud icon. You will likely need to log into your Microsoft account to open this folder and you may need your phone to authenticate the login. It is best to create a new subfolder in your OneDrive folder for your lab. This folder could be called something like \"Math 112 Labs\" so that it is easy to find and organize all of your saved Maple files. When you wish to save your file in Maple, now you can navigate to this folder and save your file with the name of the activity.   The files that you have saved on your OneDrive folder on campus can be accessed from home through a browser by installing OneDrive on a personal device.    File Types  The files that Maple saves are only readable through Maple. However, you can find the Export As tool under the File menu. From there, you can change the file type to PDF and save your document. PDF files can be read by other programs, but cannot be edited by Maple.    "

  "body": " Creating a Maple Worksheet   Recommended Tutorials  Before starting on these exercises, you should familiarize yourself with the material covered in the following tutorials:         Introduction  This activity will give you practice with:  setting up a new worksheet in Maple for future activities.  switching between paragraphs for text and execution groups for Maple input.  evaluating expressions in exact and decimal form.        Open up Maple on your lab computer. If you are asked whether you would like to update Maple, you can select No. From the start page, create a new worksheet . Worksheet mode is preferable to document mode, since it is often more user-friendly.      On the first line of your worksheet you should be in Maple input, which is indicated by the > at the start of the line. Type in your first two commands, hitting Enter to run each command:   restart;  Digits:=15;    Restarting and Digits  The first command is useful for clearing any values that are assigned in Maple and should not display output. The second command specifies that we would like 15 digits of accuracy displayed when using decimals. You should see that Maple outputs the currently assigned value of Digits after running the command.     Capitalization is important in Maple code, so always make sure that Digits has a capital D! However, semicolons are optional at the end of each command. They are used when multiple commands are used together on the same Maple input.      Create a new text group using the button at the top toolbar:   In this new paragraph, type in the following information, hitting enter for a new line between each part.     Your first and last name.      Your student number.      The name of your instructor.      The title of the activity.    The new paragraph button also provides a way to enter plain text:     Inserting paragraphs in this way will merge text and maple prompts together into a single group (as of Maple 2025). Ctrl+Shift+J and Ctrl+Shift+K are useful shortcuts for creating paragraphs after or before the current line in this way.       Open up the palettes menu on the top left-hand side of Maple by clicking the small black triangle that points to the right. You may wish to use the Expression palette for the next few exercises. Closing the context panel on the right hand side of Maple will also allow you to see more of the document.      Create a new execution group by using the   button. Type the expression and hit Enter to evaluate.    Ctrl+J and Ctrl+K are useful shortcuts for creating execution groups after or before the current line.      In a new execution group, evaluate .    Use the ^ (Shift+6) for quick exponents and the arrow keys to move the cursor. You can create a fraction by encasing the numerator, , in a set of parentheses before dividing. Alternatively, you can highlight and type the \/ key to make a fraction.      In a new execution group, evaluate .    To input a square root, you can always type the sqrt() command instead of using the button in the expressions palette.      In a new execution group, evaluate .   Using decimals  Whenever possible, Maple will produce output in exact form. However, using decimals in a Maple input will produce output in decimal form (called a floating point decimal).       Evaluate each of the expressions on a new execution group.        The mathematical constant Pi must be typed into Maple as capitalized Pi . Never type pi , unless you only wish to display the Greek letter without its numerical value.              The exp(x) mathematical functions exponential function is the exponential function, . Never type using the 'e' key on the keyboard, as Maple will not recognize it as the exponential function. However, you can find and the function in the palettes toolbar.            On each of the four Maple inputs you created in , add a semicolon at the end of the line, followed by the command evalf(%) . For example:   Two commands at once  The semicolon ; separates commands if you want to run multiple commands on the same Maple input. The ditto operator, % will recall the last output and insert it into the desired command (in this case, evalf() .    cos(Pi\/6); evalf(%);   After adding the additional command to each line, run each line a second time to see two outputs: the exact form and the approximate decimal form.      If you have accidentally created any additional paragraphs or execution groups that you wish to delete, then delete them now by clicking anywhere on that line and pressing Ctrl+Del on the keyboard.      Organize your work by using a new section for each of - using the   button. Be sure to clearly label each question by creating a section title immediately to the right of the arrow at the top of the section.    You can highlight several execution groups or paragraphs with the mouse before combining them into one section. Creating sections does not work as well in document mode, so be sure to always create a new worksheet instead of a document.  The shortcuts Ctrl+. and Ctrl+, can be used to enclose execution groups or paragraphs in a section, or to remove any section enclosing an input.       (Optional) Go back to the top of your worksheet and change the second line to: > Digits := 50; . Now run the entire worksheet by clicking on the button at the top toolbar:      "

This is especially useful for assigning expressions and functions on one Maple input, before manipulating those expressions later on in your worksheet.      In this exercise, you'll learn how to evaluate an expression at a given value of two ways: using the subs() command, and using function notation.   Instead of using the subs command multiple times, it is often a better practice to define a function and use function notation instead.      Assign the expression to expr as follows:   expr := ( sin(x) + 3)\/( cos(x) + 1);   Then use the subs() command to substitute into expr . Evaluate the result as a decimal with digits.

You will need to ensure that the plots package is loaded using the with() command. It is typically a good idea to include packages at the start of your Maple worksheet. If you close and reopen your worksheet, you will need to run the command to load the packages again.      The equation of a circle with radius and centre is given by .  Start by assigning the equation of a circle with radius and centre at the origin to the name circle . In the following exercise, you will be determining the equations of two tangent lines to this circle and plotting them with the circle. A very similar example may be found in .     Start by plotting this circle using the implicitplot() command. Make sure that the entire circle is visible and appears smooth. implicit functions implicitplot     When plotting an equation using the implicitplot() command, the graph may not always appear smooth. This was especially common in earlier editions of Maple. If this is ever the case, you may include either numpoints=30000 or grid=[250,250] as a parameter in the implicitplot() to increase the number of plot points.      There should be exactly two points on this circle where . Substitute this value of into circle and solve for the two -coordinates. You may wish to assign these values for the next steps.    If you are assigning the output of a solve() or fsolve() command to something like yCoords and there are multiple solutions, then you may use yCoords[1] and yCoords[2] as the first and second solution, respectively.      Use the implicitdiff() command to assign the derivative, , of the circle to a name such as dydx . Then, evaluate this expression at the two points where to obtain two slopes. derivative implicit     You will need to substitute both an -coordinate and a -coordinate into the derivative for each point when using the subs() command.      Now, determine the equations of the two tangent lines at these points and assign them to line1 and line2 . Make sure to include the y= in both equations, since the implicitplot() command requires each curve to be given as an equation.    Recall that the tangent line lines tangent line equation to the curve at the point is , where .    Do not forget to include multiplication between variables and brackets to indicate multiplication instead of function notation.      Plot the circle and the two tangent lines. implicit functions implicitplot     The optional scaling=constrained parameter can be included to enforce scaling. Alternatively, the optional scaling can be performed by clicking on the graph and then clicking on the button in the plot toolbar at the top of the page.

Newton's method relies on using linear approximation of the function at a point close to the desired root . You can begin by choosing a value relatively close to , and constructing the linear approximation of at : . Newton's method Because near , the -intercept of should be very close to . We can solve for this -intercept by setting equal to zero:   Assuming that this -intercept is even closer to than our initial value , we could use this new value and repeat these same steps: find the new linear approximation of at , solve for its -intercept, and call the value .   In this way, we only need one simple formula for Newton's method, that can be applied in repetition until we get our desired accuracy:  Newton's method formula Be warned though - there is always the possibility of finding a point on where equation is undefined!   Newton's method will fail for a number of different reasons:  the starting point leads to a cycle between two or more points  the iteration point is at a critical point, or  the derivative is discontinuous.

  "body": " The Shape of a Can   Recommended Tutorials  Before starting on these exercises, you should familiarize yourself with the material covered in the following tutorials:        Introduction  Your goal in this activity is to determine the height and radius of a perfectly cylindrical can that gives a total volume of 250 mL (250 cm ) and uses the least amount of material to create.   A simple can in the shape of a circular cylinder.      To construct the can, there are three surfaces: the cylindrical side and the two circles that form the top and bottom. These three surfaces will all be cut from a sheet of aluminum. The cylindrical side of the can is made from a single rectangle, so that no material is wasted from the sheet aluminum when it is cut out. However, some amount of material is always wasted from the sheet when cutting the circles for the top and bottom.  Since it is your goal to reduce the cost of material, you will have to calculate how much of the aluminum sheet will be required to construct the can, including any material that is wasted while cutting the circles. Consider a couple possible options for cutting the circles out of a sheet of aluminum.   Cutting circles in a square pattern.     Cutting circles in a hexagonal pattern.    If the circles are cut in a rectangular grid patter as in to , then you can see right away just how much extra material is wasted from the sheet of aluminum. However, if you cut out circles in a hexagonal pattern as in Figure , then you have already begun to minimize the total amount of the aluminum sheet that is required for the top and bottom.  In the exercises below, you will set up an equation for the total area of sheet metal required for the cylindrical side and the two circles, which will be cut according to this hexagonal pattern. From that equation, you will determine the height and radius of the can that minimize that area.      The side of the can can be cut from the sheet aluminum as a single rectangle, with no wasted material. One side of this rectangle has a length of and the other side has a length equal to the circumference of the can.  Determine an expression for the area of this rectangle in terms of its radius and height , and assign it to sideArea .    Since will be involved in this expression, don't forget to type the constant as Pi or use the palettes toolbar. Pi       Since each of the circles will effectively use an entire hexagonal area from the sheet metal, you will need to calculate the area of a hexagon that circumscribes a circle of radius , as shown in .   A hexagon circumscribing a circle.         The hexagon shown in consists of six equal triangles, each with a base and height . Using trigonometry, determine the length of in terms of . Then, determine the area of one of these triangles using .    You may use trigonometric ratios of and to compute the exact length of in terms of .      Determine an expression for the total area of this hexagon in terms of only and assign it to hexagonArea .       The total amount of sheet aluminum needed for the cylindrical can is given by . Assign this expression in Maple. totalArea should be an expression that relies on both the height and radius of the can.      Since the required volume of the can is 250 cm , you must satisfy the constraint . Using this constraint allows you to give totalArea as an objective function that consists only of one variable, .     Solve the volume constraint for and substitute the expression into totalArea . Then, reassign this new single-variable expression to totalArea .      Plot totalArea from part (a) over the interval r = 0 ..5 , with a vertical range of A=-200..400 . You should notice a minimum on the graph.      Use the first derivative of totalArea to determine the value of that minimizes the total area. Use the second derivative of totalArea to show that this value gives a minimum by the Second Derivative Test.    The minimum should occur at a critical value where the first derivative equals zero. Try using a solve() command to determine the exact value where this is true. If the second derivative at that point is negative, then the critical value must give a minimum.       Now that you know the radius of the can, use the volume constraint to determine the height of the can that minimizes the total amount of sheet aluminum used.   It can be shown that the ratio of height to radius of the optimized can is , regardless of volume.       Show that the ratio of height to radius is .     "

We may also be interested in finding the total change of the quantity , given by the integral . integral total change In this case, all area is positive.  We will use Maple's ApproximateInt() command to help visualize the net change and total change of a function on an interval. In addition to the method=left and method=right parameters, we can also use method=upper and method=lower to ensure that our approximation is an overestimate or an underestimate, respectively. integral approximation ApproximateInt  integral approximation ApproximateInt!method   Don't forget that you will need to load the Student[Calculus1] packages Student[Calculus1] package to use the ApproximateInt() command.

Use the ApproximateInt() command with method=right and partitions to give the Riemann sum for on the interval . Then, use the limit() command to find the limit of this value as goes to infinity. limit     The ApproximateInt() command will likely only output the net change in summation notation. You may need to force Maple to convert the summation to a closed form before evaluating the limit. To do this, follow up your ApproximateInt() output with a value(%) command before using the limit() command. The ditto operator % is a shortcut that reuses the most recent output. value  ditto operator       Compute by using the Int() command. Verify that this value matches the limit of the Riemann sum in the previous part.    You may use the inert Int() command followed by value(%) (this is typically done on the same input line, with a semicolon between commands) or the int() command, which evaluates the integral immediately.       Use the ApproximateInt() command to estimate the total change of on the interval . Use both method=upper and method=lower , with partitions. integral total change  integral approximation ApproximateInt!method     Recall that the abs() command is used for absolute values in Maple. mathematical functions absolute value       In this exercise, you will determine the exact value of the total change of on the interval , using a limit of Riemann sums as well as the convenient Int() (or int() ) command.     Use the ApproximateInt() command with method=right and partitions to give the Riemann sum for on the interval . Then, use the limit() command to find the limit of this value as goes to infinity. limit     Once again, the ApproximateInt() command will likely only output the total change in summation notation, using an absolute value. In this case, using the value(%) command might not give you a closed form of the summation!  As it turns out, evaluating total change as the limit of Riemann sums over the whole interval might not be the best way to go here. Don't worry if you can't get Maple to do what you want. You'll use the Int() command in a moment! value       Compute by using the Int() (or int() command.      In a couple sentences, describe how you could go about evaluating the total change of on the interval without needing to use the absolute value function.

  "body": " Other Integral Approximation Techniques   Recommended Tutorials  Before starting on these exercises, you should familiarize yourself with the material covered in the following tutorials:        Introduction  The trapezoid rule, the midpoint rule, and Simpson's rule are all useful numerical methods for approximating a definite integral of a function on a finite interval. Maple's ApproximateInt() command supports each of these techniques, which can be specified by setting the optional method parameter to the desired option.  Each of these techniques will have some associated error with its approximation, measured as the difference between the approximated numerical value and the actual value of the definite integral. For any particular function , it is possible to calculate the largest error (an upper bound) in its approximation for a finite number of subintervals, . In particular: Each error bound calculation relies on the width of the interval , the number of subintervals , and the shape of the function (the second or fourth derivative) on the interval.  In this activity, you will use Maple's ApproximateInt() command to help visualize these three approximation methods and then calculate the error bounds associated with them. integral approximation ApproximateInt       Assign using the assignment operator, := , and plot it over the interval .

Assume there is no time needed for you to accelerate up to your top speed. If the shore is 20 m away from you (and 70 m away from the shark), do you make it to shore before the shark attacks?   An illustration of the shark trying to catch you as you swim to shore.      For convenience, we will let the shark's initial position be m and your initial position be m. This means that the shore is at a position of m.      In this exercise, you will create a function that gives the position of the shark at time , relative to its initial position.     Calculate by hand or using Maple how long it takes for the shark to reach its top speed of 13 m\/s if it accelerates at 5 m\/s . Assign this time to t1 . Note that the shark will no longer accelerate after seconds, since it has reached its top speed.   The shark's velocity function will contain an acceleration term for (where is the time you find in exercise ) but will not have an acceleration term after seconds.       Define a piecewise function for the shark's velocity using the piecewise() command and assign this to sharkvelocity(t) . This velocity function should be linearly increasing for while the shark accelerates and then constant for . mathematical functions piecewise     You can read how to define piecewise functions in .    The shark's velocity function should look similar to the graph below.         Integrate with respect to to find the position function for the shark. Assign this piecewise position function to something like sharkposition(t) .       Since your swim velocity is constant, determining your position function is much simpler. Assign the function and integrate with respect to to find your displacement function (the net change from your initial position). Add 50 to this displacement function for your initial position and assign it to swimposition(t) .      It's time to see if you can swim to the shore before the shark catches up to you!     Plot the position functions for you and the shark on the same graph. Adjust your plot axes so that you can see the moment that the shark catches up to you.    You may wish to specify colours for each function so that you can tell which function is which.      Determine the time that the shark catches up to you. Solve for when the position function of the shark is equal to your position function. solving equations solve  solving equations fsolve     In this question, you are solving for time, . You can try using the solve() command first, and then change it to fsolve() if necessary.      Evaluate the shark's position function at this time to determine the position of the shark when it will catch you. Will you make it to the shore safely?       Instead of swimming, let's suppose you hop on your board and surf the nearest wave away towards the shore. You are initially at rest, but due to the wave, you accelerate at m\/s until you reach a top speed of m\/s.     Define a new piecewise function for the velocity of surfing the wave and assign it to .    The piecewise function for your surfing velocity will be similar to the one you set up for the shark in .      Repeating the steps from a previous exercise, determine the position of the shark when it will catch you. Will you make it to the shore safely?      "

We can find the total area between these two curves over an interval by integrating the absolute value of the difference between these two functions. In other words, . integral total area If over that interval, then the absolute value can be dropped. However, if over that interval, then the absolute value can be dropped and the order of subtraction reversed.   If for some subintervals of and for other subintervals of , then the integral must be split into these subintervals to handle the absolute value accordingly. This process typically involves having to solve for the intersection points of the functions. However, Maple handles this process automatically.   In other circumstances, we may be interested in the net area between and . For example, if and both represent rates of change of some quantity, then the net area will give us the net difference between the two quantities over an interval. The net area may be negative, while the total area will always be positive. integral net area       In this exercise, you will find the area of the region bounded by the curves and ultimately, determine the value of that gives an exact area of 576.     To begin, you should view the region between the two curves and determine how the intersection points depend on the value of .

Probability Notation  The probability notation is read as \"the probability that is between and .\" Similarly, is read as \"the probability that is less than .\" The calculation of these probabilities is done by integrating the probability density function over the appropriate interval.   Every continuous random variable has a probability density function (\"pdf\"), . If you want to compute the probability that the value of lies between and , then you integrate over that interval: .

A basic model for the population of rabbits could be given as , where is the birth rate and is the death rate.  However, equation does not consider limitations due to habitat and food supply. If you wish to use a more accurate model, then you may consider the logistic growth model , where is the relative growth rate and is the carrying capacity (the maximum population that is sustainable).  The death rate of the rabbits (due to hunting) can be added to this logistic model to obtain the differential equation , where is the hunting rate.  In the following exercises, you will examine solutions to equations using two different initial conditions: and .      Consider the basic population model in equation .

In a new paragraph in your worksheet, describe what changed from exercise by adding the death rate to the differential equation.       Most mammal population growth is dependent upon other species in the region, via an interconnected food web. One simple predator-prey model is the Lotka-Volterra model where is the population of prey and is the population of predators. In this equation, the prey grow and are eaten by predators. The predators' growth depends on eating the prey and the predators have a death rate.     Open the DE Plots tutor, listed under Differential Equations. Select the Lotka-Volterra Model and click DEPlot. Try changing the parameters and the initial conditions to get a sense of how the prey population and predator population are connected. Then click quit to display a plot on your Maple worksheet.      In a new paragraph, explain what the prey and predator populations do on this direction field.

To understand the result of the sum in equation , we can add the first few terms, called a partial sum. Looking at a sequence of partial sums, one at a time, may give an indication of the sum of the infinite series.   By looking at these partial sums, we can see that the sum is approaching the value .

Applying Integration by Parts to an Indefinite Integral  In this example, we will use the integration methods tutor to apply the method of integration by parts to the indefinite integral . After opening the tutor, we begin by typing out the function and the variable name. For an indefinite integral, we leave the interval blank and click Start. When typing out the function in the tutor, you will not have access to the palettes toolbar in Maple, so you will need to type out commands such as sqrt() for square roots. You must also include the symbol * for multiplication.  If the Get Hint button is clicked, Maple will suggest an integration technique. In this case it gives a hint that there is multiplication in the integrand, so this is a good indication that we can apply the integration by parts formula: , where and are differentiable functions.

  "title": "List of Common Errors",
  "body": " List of Common Errors  In this section, we will review some of the most common errors encountered when using Maple. Many of these errors are caused when using 2D Math, which makes complicated expressions look pretty but can cause other issues. For a description of font styles, see .   Missing Brackets  In Maple, we will use several types of brackets such as parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. Maple refers to these as delimiters. If these delimiters are not found in pairs, then Maple will be unable to understand the syntax of your command.   In this example, there is an open square bracket, but no square closed bracket.   plot( [f(x), g(x), x =-5..5);  Error, mismatched or missing bracket      Spelling Errors  Maple cannot correct for poor spelling. If a command is misspelled, then it will treat the command as a variable name.   Maple doesn't know to solve this equation if you don't spell the solve() command properly!   slove(x^2 = 4);        The % Shortcut Not Working as Intended  The % shortcut will only use the output command that was last run and not necessarily the output of the command that is on the Maple input immediately above. It is usually a good practice to use the % operator on the same line as the previous command to avoid this issue.   In this example, the expected output of the second command is the decimal value of , which is equal to . However, it appears that the second command was run again after the running third, producing the decimal approximation of the third command.   This error could have been avoided by combining the first two commands into one Maple input.   subs(x=Pi,cos(x)); evalf(%);     subs(x = Pi, cos(x));       evalf(%)       fsolve(x^3 + 4*x = 3);         Missing Multiplication Between Variables  Whenever two variables (such as and ) are multiplied together, you must explicitly include the multiplication sign between them. If no * or space is included between the variables, it may be interpreted as an entirely different variable name.   In this example, no multiplication was included between and . Maple mistakenly thinks that is the name of a third variable.   implicitplot(x^2 + y^2 = 6xy, x =-5..5, y =-5..5);  invalid input: the following extra unknowns were found in the input expression: xy      Spaces and Parentheses: Multiplication versus Functions  When typing in 2D Math (the default font), spaces and parentheses may be interpreted by Maple in unintended ways. When using commands, make sure that there is no space between the command name and its parentheses. This will be treated as multiplication.   In this example, Maple thinks that the word plot should be multiplied by the expression in parentheses. This is why the name of the command appears in the output.   plot (x^2 + 5);        Similarly, if there is no space or * between a variable name and the parentheses, the notation may be mistaken as function notation.   Clearly, Maple should be able to expand this basic expression. However, it misinterprets the user's input as being function notation. Maple reads this expression as of .   expand(2*x(x^3 - 1));          Assigning Expressions to or Other Common Variable Names  It's never a good idea to assign an expression to , , , or other common variable names. If you want to unassign everything at once, you can do this with the restart command on a separate line.   You will need to load any required packages again after running the restart command.    In this example, the value is assigned to , so the expression is equal to the value . This is remedied after using the restart command.   x := 3;       factor(x^2 - 4x - 12);       restart; factor(x^2 - 4x - 12);         Equals Signs versus Assignment Operator  The equals sign = must be used for an equation and the assignment operator := is used to store a value or expression for later use.   The equals sign should be used for the subs() command here, since we are not assigning the value for the remainder of the document.   subs(x := 5, cos(x) - 1);  Error, invalid assignment      Changing the Order of the Parameters in a Command  Many commands have multiple parameters and often the order in which the parameters is listed is important. Typing the parameters in an incorrect order in certain commands may cause an error message to be displayed when the command is executed.   In this example, the two parameters in the subs() command need to be interchanged.   subs(4x-3, x=2);  Error, invalid input: subs received 4x-3, which is not valid for its 1st argument      Assigning a Function and Not Using Function Notation  If you have assigned a function (such as ) in Maple, make sure to use function notation in other commands, rather than using only the name of the function.   In this example, the factor() command should be factor(f(x)) .   f(x) := x^2 - 4;       factor(f);         Case-Sensitive Commands  Commands are case-sensitive. Make sure to use the correct capitalization.   The correct command here is solve() , which needs a lowercase s .   Solve(3*x + 5 = 2);       There are examples of commands where the capitalized version behaves differently from the non-capitalized version.   In this example, the Int() command and int() command behave differently. Using Int() followed by value(%) is a good way to display the integral and then evaluate it.   Int(2*x, x = 10 .. 13)       int(2*x, x = 10 .. 13)        "
